Investing in the right assets has become an important financial objective for companies and individuals. Thus, stock market prediction is an 
essential tool for maximizing gains on capital invested. 
Traditional stock market forecasting strategies have primarily relied on quantitative methods, such as statistical and mathematical models that 
examine historical price data and financial indicators.
In this research, I have incorporated Sentiment Analysis of tweets about the relevant stock company to see how they impact the prediction of 
the stock prices.
I have used Apple stock price data for my project
I have used 2 batches of Apple data
From 2016 to 2020
And from 2021 to 2023
I have predicted the ‘adjusted closing’ price of Apple stock in my 
LSTM models.
